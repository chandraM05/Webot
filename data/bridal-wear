Sadly it did not happen in my case even after going way beyond my budget just to get outfit of my choice. I did showed exact images of how i wanted my outfit. Her fabric detailing was nice but the fitting and shape of the dress which outfit takes was not even close to perfect which is very essential. The engagement pictures, which we were emotionally attached  have turned unsatisfactory and shoddy because of the dress. ***

She is very professional but at the same time she is shrewd which should not be the case being a designer as customer comes with lot of hope.

Desperate to make it fit, he had to loosen one of them to the max, having to use patched on the inner sleeve and ended up ruining the embroidery around the sleeve and neckline. Despite all this, I could barely raise my arms in them on the day. And throughout this, not once did he offer an apology or acknowledge his mistake, instead blaming it on the embroiderer or having less time towards the wedding. Not at all the kind of service you expect having paid this much. Stay away, there are much better designers in Chennai. ***Less***We approached Sid for all our wedding clothes and we must say he's the best designer in town you can get !!! his attention to deta***...***Read full review***il and quality for the final attire is just top notch , doesn't compromise on quality, the best designer wear you can get & very reasonably priced , The best part of this designer is that he doesn't force you to buy anything or persuade you to buy something you don't like , Hangar ensures that you look like a star when you wear their clothes***
