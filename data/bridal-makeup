I have heard from my friends that make-up artists tend to force their opinions upon you etc. but she was not like that at all. She maintains a fine balance between giving her suggestions and taking in your inputs too. Also, she did two trials for me even though it was not requested incorporating suggestions from trial 1 into trial 2. Finally, when the D day arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that she had come to the venue not on time but before the scheduled time!! Punctuality in such occasions is of paramount importance. Lekha and team arrived and set up well on time and the end result was that I “THE BRIDE” (who is stereotyped to take the longest to get ready in our Indian weddings) was ready well before time at 4.45PM for a reception starting at 6.30PM! In fact, I was the first one on the venue to get ready. Along with speed, she did not compromise on the quality and gave me a simple classy look just the way I wanted. She uses the best brands and knows her hand well. Through the process, she was professional yet sweet and made me very comfortable. I highly recommend her to everyone, it’s a no-brainer. ***Less***Lekha was amazing to work with! I got rave reviews for my looks thanks to her impeccable skills.

Makeup for a bride is self confidence applied directly to the face! It is so important that your makeup artist understands you and help you get that look for that one day of your life that is so very important and memorable. I am not at all a fan of makeup and always wondered how people gave so much prominence to it.***
I was that kind of a bride who just walked into Ramya's studio saying "I am getting married and want you to do my makeup!" And that's it! I did not have to worry about anything. I had her do my makeup for 7 sessions and she just got better and better each time. She never failed to surprise me! Indian weddings can be really stressful and emotional. If there was one thing that I was not stressed about it was my look for the wedding. The products she uses are brilliant and lasts forever. She gave me 7 different looks every single time which just made me feel like it was my day! She had solutions to all my problems :)***
She was not only my makeup artist but also a very good friend now! Can't thank you enough Ramya you are the best! Wishing you all the success and happiness in life :) ***
Cheers,***

She was very approachable throughout the process.

Whenever in doubts, she has always been very very approachable and I could connect with her at any hour of the day or later at night.***

For my engagement, I had a navy blue outfit and she gave me an amazing complete blue smokey eye look with a tinch of shimmer in it with a baby pink lip shade. All friends and relatives totally loved the kick start look.***

She took care of 3 looks for me : Vedic Wedding (ISKCON style), Nikah and Reception and each one was different and flawless and end result was just like I wanted it to be. I had a Sabyasachi lehenga choli for Vedic wedding and wanted an overall Sabyasachi bride look. She gave me exactly the same look. For Nikah i wanted a beautiful muslim look just like the one of Deepika Padukone from Bajirao Mastani ;) For reception i wanted long curls and glamorous look to compliment my long golden trail gown with minimal jewellery. She fulfilled all my desires and her makeup, hairdo, draping were bang on point. I got so many compliments :D ***
***
She uses all high end products which are not harmful to your skin. She finds perfect base and other combinations as per your skin tone. She has a wonderful eye for color.***
***
She is thorough professional, respectfully listens to your requests, and moves throughout the getting-ready period of the day with a calm, collected stress-free attitude. She was on time and ahead of schedule. ***
***
I can’t recommend Kajol enough, she is so talented at her craft and you can tell she really loves what she does. If you’re thinking of booking her, act quick, be smarter than me and book her way in advance and convince all the girls in your party to do the same. ***

Came the D day..apart from my friend and me there were two more brides but she has an impeccable time sense and none of us faced any issues. The slots were perfectly timed. While dressing me up she was constantly showing me how the make up was coming up and if i was ok with it.  Her staff is also very good & experienced, particularly the girl who does the hair and draping.***

On my Sangeet, I danced till 4am and all my makeup was completely intact. My wedding day finished at 5am and again everything was perfect till the time I had to remove my makeup. ***
Strongly recommend her to everyone!***

I found Sukanya off wedmegood, and just loved her work from the word go, as I found her to be very versatile. I had three functions in total, including a catholic wedding reception in Bombay, and a sangeet and Nikah as part of our destination wedding in Goa. Sukanya created my looks for the Goa functions. My brief was that I didn't want to end up looking like the typical bride on any of the occasions, and Sukanya understood and complied in the best way. We had a trial session a few months before the wedding, which was immaculate. For the sangeet, she gave me a deep blue smoky eye with soft pink lips and mermaidy curls that complemented my peach and turquoise lehnga perfectly, keeping the look young and fresh. The Nikah look was slightly more traditional, with deep pink lips, deeply kohled eyes and well defined brows. My dupatta was super heavy but she found a way to pin it all perfectly. The base for my skin was so well done that it did not budge despite the humid Goa weather on both the days. All in all, I'm so glad I went with Sukanya and her team because they did a super professional job, and were also very friendly and easy to work with.

And I couldn't have been happier on both days about the way I looked, which was exactly what I wanted!***
She is extremely professional but meticulous, I was relaxed because I knew if it was even slight bit haywire, it wasn't good enough for Jyotsna and she would spend as much time needed in getting everything on point! Despite working on my bridal make-up for hours, she gave me the most beautiful bun for the wedding which was classy and neat, more than I expected. When she says her make up is long lasting it really is, for it lasted 12 hours without a single spec moving (visible in all my pictures) all the way till the vidai. I loved Jyotsna because she goes that extra mile, like putting a small double sided tape below your maang tika so that it doesn't wiggle/move even when you're dancing! I believe one of the best decisions I made was having Jyotsna as my MUA for the two crucial days and I really regret not having found her earlier for my engagement!

She is the only make-up artist who I have come across that did not make me look like I have make up caked on, yet amplified my looks in a natural way and also made me look like a bride. I’ve been very picky with the way I want my make-up done but she knew exactly what to do and how to do it. My make-up did not smudge one bit! Not only did she make me look and feel amazing and confident, she made all the ladies in my family look equally stunning. Not one person was given less attention than the bride which also meant a lot to me. We all got compliments the whole day. I will continuously recommend Shwetha and her team!

Zorain responded back to my query quickly, set up a trial with me, and was very open to any questions and concerns I had.  We worked together to create the look I wanted.  She answered multiple calls from me while I was shopping and gave me advice about what kind of hair accessories and make up to buy for touch ups.  She showed up on time to my venue (I got married in a very remote locale) and came prepared with anything and everything I would need to get ready.  Her makeup application was flawless and she drew out my best features.  I had no idea I could look like that!  Hairstyling was also superbly done with an updo that kept my heavy dupatta in place all day.  Zorain did my lengha dupatta draping and helped me get my jewelry on as well.  Despite the weight of my outfit, Zorain's expert pinning and draping kept everything in place well into the evening over 12 hours later.  (This was a huge concern of mine as I had a sari fall apart on me once when another makeup professional did the draping for a cousin's wedding...Zorain totally came through on this concern, though!)   To top it off, her calm presence and genuine concern helped me keep it together the morning of my big day.  From the moment I arrived at my wedding 'til now, I have not stopped getting compliments on how great I looked.  Zorain, you are true make up genius and I thank you for being so wonderful and attentive to your brides!!  ***Less>>>
