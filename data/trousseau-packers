It's a very light weight steel box, powdered coated with Matt black paint. And on top of it, there is a huge dark grey moustache, taking the swaginess of the Pitaara to a different level.***
It is a very compact carry bag with dimensions of 28cm by 20cm by 10cm, accompanied by a sleek leather sling attached to the Pitaara with elegant brass hooks.***
The inside of the Pitaara is covered with grey colored foam on all surfaces, which enhances the shock absorption and also protects my belongings.***
Along with that, I got a really sweet letter from Megha and Shikha( the makers) stating how much love they had put in making that Pitaara. Kudos to them!***
Overall, I must say, a very quality and trendy product. As they say 'To stay in the trend, you must think out of the BoX'. ***Less***Beautiful and amazing hand-crafted collection for trousseau and gifting needs. Had a great experience. Highly recommended!>>>
