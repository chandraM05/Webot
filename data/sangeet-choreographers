We communicated on whatsapp and they helped us pick songs. By the time we arrived in Mumbai, they had fused the music and choreographed everything. None of us a born dancers but Shailendra and Heta made us feel so comfortable with the steps. We were taught at a speed that was comfortable for us and the whole experience was extremely personalized. One of the songs I picked was in Telugu which none of them were familiar with and yet they did such a great job finding the right steps to go with the beats! They worked with us on a time slot for 5 days and even helped us with booking studios since we didn't have place to practice at home. I cannot thank them enough for their dedication and for making the impossible possible for us!!! ***Less***I recently got my sangeet choreographed by Shailendra Chaj and 2 others.

Thank you for the extra effort that you had to put by coming all the way to Ranchi and spend hours teaching us. Even after so many sessions in the day, every session seemed like the first one with the unbeatable amount of energy that you guys showcased.  The most special thing about you guys is the connection that you built with us in such less time.  We are going to miss our Sangeet practices with you guys. Would love to work with you guys again. ***
