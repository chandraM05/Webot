One thing is sure, they love their work and thus come up with new ideas that they also enjoy learning that it wouldn't be one another or common delivery for your occasion. ***
I have already hired them to do my hen, Mehandi giveaways and wedding cake. ***

I can truthfully say the cake you made for her wedding was the very best I have ever tasted and the most beautifully decorated I have ever seen!

It is a relief and huge help when your vendors can work together well. I think the cake looked beautiful, but also it was exactly what we wanted! This review and pictures can barely do justice to the overall experience and how truly wonderful our cake was from cake design company. ***Less>>>
