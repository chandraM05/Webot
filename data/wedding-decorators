I was so amazed by the elegance and the attention to detail. What attracted me the most was the photobooth setup. Now anyone can do a photobooth setup, conventional placards. Same old same old. ***
But pink parrots nailed it with their absolutely unique placards and props customized to suit the bride and groom.***
They did the decor for my mehndi/sangeet ceremony and it was beautiful! I had a customized canopy set up, the blend of lights and colors and a dash of origami decor wowed me! In fact, everyone liked it so much, that they decided to sit there to click a few pics!***
I am extremely happy and satisfied with their ability to turn a blank hall into something so colorful and merry! I loved how the decor colors went with the color of my lehenga! How the photobooth setup was full of life and fun!***
Pink parrots meet your expectations and go far beyond that! I would definitely recommend them to soon to be brides and grooms for their wedding functions.***
Lastly! Thank you guys! My mehndi ceremony was a special one and I think that's largely because pink parrots went above and beyond their call of duty to make it perfect! ***

Pink Parrots gave me ethereal settings and went over board in ensuring that everything flew seamlessly  even when there was absolute mayhem with surprises.

We weren't one of those people who knew exactly what they wanted, but we knew what we didn't. Janki helped transpire those vague words into a gorgeous setup for us on our big day! She is full of ideas which was a blessing for us because our venue, while being outdoors, was not the most conventional space. On our first meeting, her enthusiasm was contagious! Her eye for detailing and putting a careful thought into everything is what sets her apart from the rest of the garish crop. Janki also has great taste, which instills faith from the get-go. While being creative with the decor is her job, she is also on point with the logistical, practical facets. Another thing about her is that she doesn't just do big, lavish weddings. Ours was a fairly small reception setup, but despite that she put her heart and soul to it - it wasn't some junior who was dealing with us. It's her personal touch and dedication that makes Altair so special. We had a couple of last minute hiccups too, for which she went out of her way and ironed them out.

I wanted a vintage themed card with mini inserts and she did a spectacular job.

From endless calls to minute changes, she was always there making sure that my vision was achieved. Her creative and aesthetic senses are very unique and she always had various ideas to offer! Thank you Janki for the gorgeous invites, the cute thank you notes and for the beautiful wedding vow fans. The entire wedding stationery was based on the artwork created by Janki and her team and all of it was hugely appreciated! Most of all, thank you for being more of a friend throughout the entire process, and for sharing various wedding related inputs during that period. It was an absolute blast working with you! =D ***

I wanted***...***Read full review***the decor for this day to be a compilation of my favourite things with a blend of dreamy, mystical, bohemian elements and I found just the right person to make my dreams come to life. I came across Janki Desai from Altair Decor’s work at numerous luxury fashion events I was a part of due to work and the constant perfection in her details assured me she was the one. Janki and I worked together for almost 6 months to bring my far-fetched Pinterest dreams into something tangible. We had amazing decor elements – from White Garden Chairs for a relaxed theatre seating during dance performances, Picnic table-bench seating, Ferris wheels as table centre-pieces to represent London Eye (Where Shailin asked me out on a date 5 years ago) etc. My favourite was the Book & bulb hanging installation to represent my love for reading and the overflowing script photo booth with our love story inscribed within. ***Less>>>

Decor is the most important part of the wedding especially for a person like me who is very particular and well researched in this matter. I am sure this wouldn't have been an easy task for them to manage my choices, the time restrictions, my family's inputs, the budget and various other constrains. Even with all of that Ambika, Heena and Zaid did such a wonderful job with not just the decor but the aesthetics and the ambiance of all the three events. ***
Let's start from the beginning. One thing about this team is that they get what you want with the little details and few Pintrest pictures; they then use their creativity to put in so many small details and make it look even more better and grander than what you imagined. That is exactly what happened at mine and Ahad's wedding.***
***
For the Haldi and Mehendi event at home I   and every other guest was blown away by the ambiance and the aura of the place. Just the right colours, flowers, qurks of personalized banners, darban style seating, such a well decorated Jhula and much more. It was a hall that I never imagined that could have turned into something so beautiful. ***
 ***
I especially loved and have a soft spot for the sangeet decor (Hyatt Regency). Probably I had the most fun there, or it had my favourite colours and the fairy lights from the huge kabana brightened my entire evening, mainly cause it was much much prettier than what I had in mind. Even pictures won't do justice to it and I am so glad this was a part of my special moment in Moroccan style.***
***
Then was the main  event - Reception in ITC which was for around 1500 people with guests from all over the world. I can imagine that it's not an easy task to make the 6 halls look well done with the huge stage. A-CUBE pulled this off with such Grace, elegance and beauty. The stage was one of a kind with just the right touch of poise. I got my grand flowers droping from the celing effect on stage which looked marvelous. The silver autumn leaves illuminated all the halls with so much brightness and grand radiance. The entire ambiance left all our guests in Aww.  ***

Even though I wanted something extremely simple and minimalistic, they made the setting look so fun and colourful for the mehendi and elegant during the wedding. Also, I think that approachability is very important and unlike many other vendors, Rishita and Anusha were always just a call away. Since two of our functions were at home, all my guests were amazed at how beautifully they'd transformed the space to look so good! ***

Their design sense is distinctive and they can make your space stand out without being gaudy. I absolutely love their work and would recommend them to anyone planning any event! ***Less>>>
