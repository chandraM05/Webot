I came across them by chance on WedMeGood***...***Read full review*** and absolutely loved their work (they had done everything from vibrant and flowery invitations to  more subtilely elegant cards). Then, I had the good fortune of winning a free digital design consultation by them on instagram! There was absolutely no pressure to purchased printed cards from them but from the moment we began working together, I knew they would be the ones to design my invitations. Suneet is kind, patient, and very intuitive. It felt like she knew me and my fiance better than we knew ourselves. She picked up on our likes and dislikes with just a few pins on our mood board. And the final product by their team was exceptional. It fit both my family's and my fiance's family's vision perfectly! My mother-in-law was pretty certain that she would just have cards made for their events separately but the suite Suneet and her team designed immediately won her over. There also very accommodating to budgets so if there's even a doubt in your mind about contacting them, let me allay your fears. Your invitation is the first impression of your wedding to your friends and family. Make it count!  ***Less***Amazing ! Creative and beautiful.

Bespoke in its artistic approach and prolific in its execution, Sonal Aggarwal, the owner of Turmeric Ink, had outdone herself again. Every time I think she’s already put out her best, bam! she comes out with something more. The box that I received went beyond the quintessential wedding card. It was a storyteller. As I slid out the top casing, the skillfully compartmentalized boxes serving as caskets for miniature jam and preserve bottles, lay ajar. But right at the top, was the most beautifully envisioned wedding card with the names of the bride and groom embossed in calligraphy. It was truly one-of-a-kind idea, personifying the art of personalization that we values these days. What I found particularly interesting was that once it served its primary purpose—that of being an invitation—it has now doubled up as my watch and jewellery case. It lays in a cozy corner of my cupboard, being a box of happy memories from my brother’s wedding. Thank you so much turmeric ink team! I always have and will further always recommend you to people!  ***Less>>>

Disha is an extremely patient creator, who incorporates all your inputs; shows you the blue-print and helps you decide. Never did she once brush aside any of our ideas and never did she once brush aside any of our inputs; no matter how minor a change it could be. She toiled on our cards, went back and forth on our designs, sent us numerous rough drafts until we were satisfied, and has always been available. The final output resulted in a beautiful, elegant and an aesthetically designed card. I fell absolutely in love with my invite and our families and invitees couldn't stop admiring them. It has been the best wedding invite I have set my set on and people complimenting us with 'It has been the best wedding invite we have ever received.'***

Disha, Harsh and the entire team of Customizing Creativity deserves all the kudos. Never have I seen people so patient. They take their job, passion, and their professionalism very seriously. And I admire them for that. ***

They did a beautiful job beginning from the designing process to the layout. They were very patient to understand what we were looking for.

Mekala is an extremely talented artist, with a strong creative and innovative bent to her art, the willingness to listen to her client's ever-changing needs, and the ability to respond effectively and quickly with a design that exceeded our highest expectations. She made our wedding invitation card, and every single recipient has told us it is one of the most unique, beautiful, and fun cards they have ever seen.***
***
We found Mekala through an internet search, and were blown away by some of the various designs she had made. We still had some doubts about whether she would be able to realize our vision for the card design, since it was so personalized. I like biking and my fiancée likes running, and so we had a rudimentary idea about a card that depicted both. With the very limited input we provided her, she came up with a suggestion to make a sliding card that shows me on a bicycle catching up to my fiancée running, with a lovely park background and creative Indian details throughout. She Skyped with my fiancée in order to confirm the design and brainstorm how to make it quirky and unique for our taste, but also appeal to the older generation. She captured our features very accurately from the few pictures we had sent, and made a near-perfect design on the first go. We wanted to try out a few color changes, add Ganesha symbols, and even came up with last minute additions for a Sangeet card, two RSVP cards, and repeated text changes. Mekala didn't hesitate in the least, and turned out truly unique, aesthetically beautiful, and eye catching designs for each of the items we asked. Through the process, she was extremely prompt (even when we weren't), worked around our schedule, met our tight timelines, coordinated with the printing press and ensured they corrected some card assembly mistakes they had made, and turned out a beautiful end product. Our friends are now saying they want to get her help for their future card designs! ***Less***Mekala was awesome!

It includes a lot of illustrations depicting various factual Tambrahm events. I must***...***Read full review*** just say that she did a fabulous job with the design. The highlights I would like to mention are, here timely response and pace of her work, the capability to understand what a customer needs, ability to convert that exactly into illustrations, adding her creativity and style on top of the design, professionalism,  and most importantly the classy product (invitation) itself. I would highly recommend her for all kinds of wedding invitations (especially to people from India). Guys, its super worth it. ***

Mekala, I wish you all success in your future endeavors. Keep up the good work. I will surely work with you very soon :) ***Less>>>

I am from the U***...***Read full review***SA and had a frantic 2 weeks in India to kick off the planning. After meeting with 4 different designers, Itchha was a breath of fresh air. Her designs are unparalleled in their elegance, beauty and most of all creativity. As so many reviewers before me have mentioned she has an ability to take a concept, idea or your style and turn it into something truly incredible. She has an amazing eye for detail and makes sure to steer you in the right direction, while always respecting your personal vision. Her cards are striking and yet, consistently something you have not seen before -  all with a unique twist to keep every couple’s cards special.***
***
Throughout this process, you learn that not being in the same location or time zone you need to REALLY trust your vendor. They are responsible for producing something memorable for you and without a doubt I can tell you that Itchha, as a person and as a professional, is someone you can trust implicitly. It was seriously a joy to work with her these months – I am going to miss our what’s app chats! She was always available, has GREAT advice, and patient with all the constant wrinkles weddings throw at you.***

Itchha Talreja Designs was one of the best vendors I worked with during our wedding planning process. There is nothing short of amazing when it comes to Itchha - her creativity, punctuality and expert advice are just a few of the many positive qualities about her! I came across Itchha's page on Instagram and was instantly impressed! I did not want the usual Indian wedding invitation - we were looking for a simple invite with a unique twist. The most heart warming quality of Itchha is that she made an effort to learn about John and I before she could design our invites and that spoke volumes because she truly takes pride in her work to make every invite unique that's tells a story. The minute she found out that we got engaged in Paris she was sooo excited to start designing and the proof is in the work!***
***
We are still receiving SO many positive compliments from our guests regarding the invitations - many would not believe that they came designed from India!! ***
***
Overall, I am grateful for Itchha and her amazing creativity and keen attention to detail - the invites were magical and with only communicating via text/email from across the globe she made the process so stress free! Take my advice and send Itchha an email for your wedding invitations! ***

Coming to the card printing in itself- the work was flawless and done ever so punctually that despite my usually anal attitude, I was on cloud nine upon receiving the cards (so much so that I don't want to give it to the guests and part with them)!***

Once my wedding dates were fixed, I scouted all websites that listed out wedding service providers. I singled out 'The Paper Thingie', in a website called 'Dhaamdhoom.in'.***
 A little more research about the company in various online platforms got me convinced to pursue it further.  I was focused in what I wanted. My mantra was simple, 'Keep it minimal and elegant'. Most of the service providers were pricey and gave me very little freedom to design my card. But 'The Paper Thingie' was very creative with its portfolio.***
When I got in touch with Anusha Rao, Director of the company, I was surprised to speak to some one who was  rooted in social etiquette and manners. She was very friendly and precise with the process. I was happy that she wished me well for my future and asked me to  contact her day or night without reserves. ***
The pricing was reasonable and she informed me that she would charge only after the designs are finalized and ones the cards are set for print. She told me that she 'trusted' her clients, something that was rare to hear from business people these days.***
Once we got down to the designs, we worked relentlessly to understand my specific needs and would not take any instruction for granted. She gave me various designs, pictures, samples and fonts to choose from and tried to understand my taste. ***
I have never heard her say a 'No' from her end. Even if it took a lot of iterations, she patiently ensured that I was happy with the end product. I had given her the entire amount in advance before I could finish my designs.  She followed-up with me periodically and was prompt with her deliverables. ***
I mailed the soft copies of the invites to my friends and I had a lot of them complimenting me about the card. I am writing this testimony as a happy bride and on behalf of my friends who find the cards stylish. I am glad to have done this with someone who carries great work ethics. It only made the process all the more beautiful and memorable for me.***
I wish the company the best and to give many more cards as a souvenirs for future brides and make their weddings special. ***Less***When we wanted to keep our wedding super simple and yet elegant, we did not look further than the paper thingie. the head designer***...***Read full review***, Ms. Anusha, was extremely helpful and meticulous in providing us what we wanted and that too, well within our budget. ***
