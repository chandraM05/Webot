***
Everything from the pre-wedding shoot, to the actual wedding went better than we expected. The communication skills, professionalism and talent that Shutterink possesses is what makes them stand out. They do go the extra mile, and they do care about what they do. It shows in their work! Thanks again Nitin and Sandeep and team, we were lucky to have you guys for our events! ***Less***I would always stalk wedding images by shutterink on facebook. So when finally my wedding with Ashish was finalised i knew i wante***...***Read full review***d shutterink to do the wedding photography. Amidst all the suggestions pooling from all sides, we both knew that we want no photography team other than Shutterink. ***
Our first encounter with Nitin and Sandeep ( along with other professionals of the team) took place in Kerala. Kerala was decided as our pre wedding shoot location after many cancellations and change of plans. The first time we met the Shutterink team, we knew that they are not just photographers or film makers by qualification or profession but they are people who love their jobs and capturing handpicked moments is something that lifts them up. Those 2 days of shoot were an experience of a lifetime. Never ever we had encountered a team which was die hard professional and super friendly at the same time. Each and every member of the crew was fun loving and happy go lucky. Most importantly, they understood us as a couple and did the best to bring out the shots which came to us naturally. Not to forget, it was their enthusiasm which kept us going. ***
The Shutterink team also covered our wedding which was an elaborate affair at Fairmont, Jaipur. Both the bride side and groom side were taken care of very well.. every person was extremely cooperative given the hush rush and back to back functions and rituals. It could be easily felt that the team wants to leave no stone unturned in their journey of creating stunning photographs, films and albums. Not only did the make Ashish and me very comfortable but also took into account the needs and demands of our family members. It was because of them that we never grew tired of endless posing and thouroughly enjoyed getting clicked throughout. ***
And as expected, when the images and films were handed over to us, we knew it was going to be everlasting treasured testament of our dream story. We absolutely love how the most important days of our lives are reflected in your narration of our wedding story. ***
Nitin and Sandeep, you guys are great and we could not be more grateful for having you guys as our lead photograhers for our wedding. Thanks a tonne for putting in your heart and soul to bring out such brilliant clicks and videos! ***

CaughtCandidcom-41116 ! IndoreBhopal ! 5.0 !  ! ***My experience with Caught Candid team was the most wonderful, satisfying and stress-free experience than I had ever even imagined***...***Read full review***it would be. My husband and I are both very camera conscious and wedding is the one time where all cameras are focused on you. However the best decision that we made was choosing Balwant and his team. The team consisted of 5-6 people and they were really creative and organized. Two of the six guys would click the traditional photos of the couple, two would focus on the family and relatives and the other two – hidden somewhere one wouldn’t know about clicking candid shots of the couple. We were never pestered to pose and they caught every moment just like how it was. We also introduced them to our close family arrived. Looking back at the picture I realize that they have captured every single person. The reason I am so sure about this is because my friend’s mom could only make it to one event hardly 5 minutes. However they got one of the best candid picture of me with her. Balwant was on his toes all the time and coordinated everything very well. The quality of their work is BEYOND PERFECTION. The pictures came out so amazingly well. It takes a while for any photographer to share the thousands of pictures from the wedding. However the Caught Candid team was really accommodating and picked out a collection of few pictures from the events for us to share with family and friends within a couple of weeks in spite of it being the busy wedding season. One small bit that I wasn’t happy about is the background score that I had specifically chosen for my entry got overridden in the wedding video probably during the editing by the videographer. But I don’t blame the team and I should’ve specified it to them before. To be honest I don’t care much about it since all the other stuff was just TOP NOTCH. The team was very friendly and made sure to keep all of us really comfortable. They always had a smile on their faces. I very strongly recommend the Caught Candid team and you won't be disappointed!

***
One of the best things I liked about him was the fact that he spent quality time with us, getting to know us and our families before the wedding. That certainly helped on the wedding day, where we looked at Ishan as our friend, rather than just a photographer. He also advised us on other things such as decor, make-up, dresses, etc. It was very helpful to have a photographer's opinion on these things.***
***
I am very happy with his work. Ishan's style is very subtle, with minimal post-processing, giving the photos a natural feel. Ishan and his team have a great eye for the smaller things in a wedding; they clearly know and understand the purpose of various ceremonies within and around a wedding.***

He arrived early on the day of the wedding and stayed back even after the reception to capture some shots, not to forget a complimentary mehendi photoshoot:)***

He is a no fuss photographer who gets involved in an inconspicuous manner. I think he has certain shots in mind when shooting a wedding depending on the couple, setting and feel of the wedding. He goes out of the way to get those shots like a good artist (to the extent he spent some time trying to fix a lighting glitch at my wedding to get the desired shots). We wanted a couple of pics next day to share with family and friends and Gautam sent them promptly. I have now received the remaining pics and love them. Thanks Gautam for capturing our memories so well. Best wishes. ***Less>>>

 ***
Before we start writing anything, we would like to say “A Big Thank Y***...***Read full review***ou to, Rohan & Puja. You have made our wedding experience so memorable.”***
Meghna and I were in a relationship for past 7 years. From the day we got engaged, we started to hunt for a Candid Wedding Photographer in Jaipur.***
***
A photographer who can capture the ‘Soul’ of being in ‘LOVE’ and at the same time force you to be in love with yourself too. And we found that combination in Rohan and Puja.***
Once everything was on the cards, Rohan & Puja came up with some valuable suggestions related to Make-up, Dresses, Venue Decorations and so many small & big things.***
***
One thing which is really appreciable about these guys was that they always reverted on time as and when they promised.***
We were amazed to see their preparations on our Pre Wedding shoot. They were all set to make it “An Experience of a Lifetime” for us. There's a lot to describe but I would only say one word that at the end of that day we were feeling proud of our decision for selecting them.***
***
Rohan : A guy with a simple, sweet and quiet nature but would make you realize that how beautiful or handsome you are through his outstanding photography skills.***
His unconditional and continuous efforts to make his clients happy and satisfied will always be his best part to choose him for the special day.***
***
Puja : The best partner for Rohan I would say...as her vivacious energy will slowly grow on you and she has the ability to bring out those magical moments through her clicks.***
She would be continuously thinking and coming up with ideas to get that perfect frame. Also a bride can always see a sister as a photographer in her.***
 ***
You can find many photographers with excellent work but Rohan and Puja will still stand on top of them. Because they shoot your wedding as they would have done for their special day :).***
Thanks Once Again To Rohan Mishra Photography.***
Hope your success continues... This is straight from the heart….***

As an amateur photographer, it was a joy to watch their teamwork analyze and execute each shoot. Without any prior setup, they were able to make each setting work and produce photos that I could not even visualize at the time of shooting. Rohan & Puja clearly demonstrate that photography is far more than just having high-end camera equipment. The quality of the final product is absolutely determined by one’s talent, and these two have it in spades ***Less***The best professional team I ever met. ***

Pooja makes people very comfortable with her friendly approach and jovial nature. ***
***
The second shooter has amazing abilities. In fact they all work well as a team. ***
***
One thing that was evident across every single one is their "Passion" to do things. They all worked their socks off as if its thier own function.***
***
I emphasize, they really work hard to get best out of the time and space that you give them.***
***
On the other hand, these guys are down to earth. They listen to you, appreciate your views on certain things and execute them. ***
***
They are punctual, in fact the group arrived 1 hour before their scheduled time.***
***
These guys are very flexible with schedules. I have to say this, Rohan stepped the extra mile with his recommendations on bridal wear, stage decors, etc. If you decide to work with him, definitely get his recommendations on things other than photography as well. ***
***
Rohan and Pooja always give attention to details. There is a charm in every single thing they do. To get a feel, simply get a quote from them for their services and look at the way they send you the quote. They are different from rest of the pack.***
***
I know many studios post process their images using softwares (photoshop, lightroom to name a few) to make images look better, ofcourse intensifying the contrast and vibrance in images will make them look good. But the most important aspect where these studios fall behind is "creativity". And here is where Rohan and team stands apart. Look at some of his portfolio images.***

I had wonderful experience working with these "Professionals" from day one and with God's blessings I wish this team to succeed in all of their future endeavors. ***Less>>>

Easier as it may seem, to few lucky couples, it is a daunting task for who lives 8000 miles away. After contacting people all across India, photographers, long lost friends, relatives(that we never knew existed)  and what not we fortunately came across Pixel story. As much we loved the photographs that they had clicked before, we didn’t have to think twice after skyping with  Sudha and Mukesh . Both of them have such warmth that you’ll feel you made the right decision.  Sudha and Mukesh are easiest to work with and are very accommodating. With a very tight schedule that we had for our wedding we were left with no time for pre wedding shoot  (which by the way turned out unexpectedly beautiful ). They accommodated an early morning shoot and believe it or not turned a small patch into a ‘DDLJ sarson ka kheth’. They got along so well with us and especially with our families that everyone believed that they are our friends from Banglore who happens to take pictures too. Indeed now they are our friends from Banglore. We absolutely love the way they cover the entire wedding and become a part of it.  Trust me you’ll know what ‘omnipresent’ is :D***
Sudha and Mukesh are as great of people as the photographs they take. I would highly recommend pixel story and if you are looking for ‘friends from Banglore who happen to take beautiful pictures too’ you can find them here at pixelstory.***

My husband and I were so impressed with our pre-wedding shoot that we added on more services. Sonu and Nitin were so great to work with as well. They felt like our friends more than vendors. ***

Once we received our first set of pictures, we were floored. Both of us are very particular since we have family in the business.  Ankit's eye for detail is on point! All of his pictures are stunning. The team maintained their deadlines, which was great since we were so excited to see the pictures. Ankit captured so many special moments that we barely even realized were happening. The best part of it was the demeanor of the team. They were calm, professional and fun to work with. The wedding went by in such a blur, we look back at the pictures and it reminds us of how special it was. ***

Because of this he was able to capture some of the best candid moments from my wedding since everyone was very comfortable with him. ***

On the day of the wedding, even my fiance preferred to have her pictures to be shot by Anand instead of her photographers.

The best of all, This kind of talent comes with an even more awesome human being. He is professional, ever - smiling, so humble and has great work ethic. That just makes everything  operationally so much easier. If you have Anand as your photographer, you know atleast one area of your event, you absolutely dont have to worry about.

The extra effort he made to know our background made all of us feel very comfortable around him. He has a knack for figuring out who all the important people at the wedding are and capturing them in their best candid moments. Although I loved the traditional photography, I would say his mastery lies in his candid shots. He really creates magic with his camera when it comes to candid. I would also like to give a special mention for his dedication towards his work and art. In our case, although we did not insist, the team stretched and covered extra events like mehendi, early morning muhurtam(for which his team had to bunk overnight at the green room). After the wedding, we urgently requested for a slide show of our photos for the reception. This was a sudden request, and he could have easily refused, as the turnaround time was a few hours, but he was magically able to create a beautiful slideshow for us in no time. We highly recommend Third Eye Photography to everyone, it’s a no-brainer ***Less>>>
