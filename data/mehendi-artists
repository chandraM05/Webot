When it comes to mehendi artistry, there is absolutely nobody better than Shalini. ***
***
She offers a wide variety of exquisite themes and designs to choose from so every bride (and other clients) can find something that suits their personality. She also customizes her own designs: I wanted a mixture of certain motifs (I love the bride-groom, peacocks and lotuses) and she took my vision and created the most exquisite mehendi I’ve ever seen. I had an outstation wedding and got my mehendi done by Shalini 3 days in advance so I was worried about the color fading by the main event (travel + washing up etc) but the mehendi turned out almost black and stayed black-oxblood for 10 days and started fading slowly after almost 2.5 weeks. Every single person I met while I had my mehendi on asked me where I got it done from because both the pattern + the color were superb. You could see every little detail and she incorporated madhubani designs with her famous parrot design for the back of my arms and I could not be happier with how dark even this back arms were. ***
***
I think the fact that Shalini uses herbal, all-natural mehendi is extremely important. She cares about her clients and she makes sure to only use the highest quality ingredients. I have very sensitive skin and this is the first time in my life that I had a new substance applied to my skin and there was no adverse reaction. I followed her instructions for post-application care and kept my mehendi for around 30 hours, which was a lot of effort, but the results were magnificent! ***
***
Shalini is a true artist but more than that, she is a lovely person. I could not have a proper function in Delhi since we had our flights in 12 hrs so I only got my own bridal mehendi done by her. I initially regretted not being able to enjoy the fun and festivities of the mehendi ceremony but spending time with Shalini was like being with a friend and we gossiped and had chai and shared so much that I could not have been happier. I had lots of last-minute problems and she was so cooperative. We changed the timings twice and had to change the venue and she had to stay till 2am and she never displayed any frustration; on the contrary she was so comforting and had such a calming effect on all of us. I felt so grateful for her company because she kept me peaceful through all the crises and by the end of the experience she had become a part of the family. ***
***
My bridal mehendi was one of the few things that I was really particular about and every single time I look at my wedding photos I say a prayer for Shalini. She is a wonderful person and an artist extraordinaire. I think every bride should call her if they want a lifetime of memories and compliments. I can’t wait to meet her again for other festivals and occasions. ***
