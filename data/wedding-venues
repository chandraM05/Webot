The menu on offer, overall ambiance and most importantly, the follow-ups and responses by the team were quite impressive. I must admit that there was 'Value-for-money" evident in relevant aspects of my dealing with Country Inn. In fact, my daughters are already pestering me to have a weekend stay here after a while so that they get to experience the luxury taste of the hotel.

The hotel has 70 cozy rooms, I think enough to accommodate your Wedding guests or you can shift here from your house to experience everything under a roof so my bride's family has done the same & we have booked 60 rooms.

Quiet decent buffet spread in Breakfast as we have gone along with basic menu..& have done Lavish one for the Brunch & Lunches..I loved their  "South Indian" though, very authentic. :)***
The entrance lobby of this Hotel is not too spacious and is the only one thing I disliked about the Hotel because when you have a group of people to check in at the same time, it gets really crowded and so the Hotel lobby's should be spacious enough with comfortable seating to avoid discomfort. ***

Exceptional ambience and amenities, incredibly helpful management team and total value for money. We had over 400 guests at the venue and every single one of them had a total blast and loved the celebrations. I would highly recommend Pergola and their services for any wedding related celebrations/ parties. Visit the place once and try booking in advance since the venue gets booked out soon. ***
***
Oh! And did I tell you? Pergola has a musical fountain with light shows and the works - it looks magical in the evening!***
***
 I recently married the love of my life and we hosted the Sangeet and Mehendi functions at Pergola. After extensive evaluation of the venues in Bangalore in terms of price, location and ambience/amenities - we finalized on Pergola. What really gave us confidence was that it has metro connectivity to people travelling from across the city and the central location of the venue easily accessible by all modes of transportation. Pergola offers ample parking space, beautiful location setting complete with the musical fountains, hammocks, two luxurious rooms and lots of greenery at  the venue. I loved the transparency, open communication throughout the entire process of booking, planning and executing the event. As I look back upon my experience the following three things stood out to me:***
***
Management Team: Among the most professional, resourceful and accommodating teams that I have encountered. We needed a DJ to play at the event and we were struggling to find someone - Prashant and Vinod (the owners) arranged for the same within a day's notice. My wife wanted to contribute socially through our wedding expenses  and with the help of the Pergola team, we were able to secure the services of Granny's Pizza, a social enterprise that performs delightful catering and proceeds go towards supporting an old age home. Our celebrations ran well past our scheduled cutoff time - and the Pergola team members stayed back to help us wrap up the event without charging any additional fees. Five stars to the Management Team!***
***
Bang for Your Buck: The total expenses was completely within our budget and considering the facilities offered at the venue, I would consider Pergola to be a total value for money. Its spacious, has ample parking space, very thoughtfully designed spaces, the musical fountains and the luxurious rooms were all included in the package with no additional charges. There was complete transparency and no hidden charges like some of the other venues in Bangalore, which helped us plan our finances very effectively and we were able to throw a memorable party with very limited budget. ***
***
Ambience and Amenities: It’s a very serene location filled with greenery and the thoughtfully designed spaces make Pergola a special place. We had complete privacy with high walls and trees covering the venue from all sides. The venue is huge and can comfortably accommodate close to 600 people. There is sufficient parking space for everyone. The sprawling green lawns, abundance of greenery and large trees, the rustic feel to the place because of the way it is designed make the evenings at Pergola appear magical. There are hammocks sprinkled around the venue, lights crawling up the trees complete with a mini stage with the musical fountains in the backdrop for the events to take place. The 2 rooms are luxurious complete with all the required facilities and the visitors feel like they are in the middle a nature resort in Bangalore***
***
Overall, I was delighted with my experience at Pergola and their management team and I would highly recommend their services to anyone. You will have an amazing time at your party celebrations and your relatives/friends will rave about it for a very long time.***

Cheers!***
