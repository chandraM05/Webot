From the beginning till the very end of the 3 events and one of them being wedding were all about team work and dedication ( even in the food and in customer service) the desire and the fulfilment of providing a stupendous, brilliantly executed food catering to nri clients and there friends and family).***
Mamapaati caterers did the catering, ofcourse after sampling 90% of the dishes at their restaurants  and i must say their management and execution were out of this world. The food was fresh, not very spicy, cooked to perfection . Hard work , execution of the instructions strictly given by the guest was felt till the very last bite.***
The buffet set up done was beautiful , the cutlery , crockery , glasses, chaffing dishes  ,napkins, servers , props..could a guest ask for more when it comes to making a 1000 pax wedding a grand success .The fact that they served the snacks from 7 pm till 6 am in the morning just blew me away. All in all , i got more than what i paid for. Excellent work. ***Less>>>
