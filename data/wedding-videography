Things started when we decided to get married at the Heritage Resort in Manesar. After choosing the venue, I got to know that one of my school friends is into events and since we wanted to hire someone to plan our two days, I touched base with him. He recommended me a lot of vendors for decor, dj, artist management, and finally for photography. My family functions were being covered by a renown studio of delhi since 7-8 years. But when my friend showed me LM's profile - Safarnama, I was sure I wanted something on these lines. And believe me, it was one of the best decisions we took. His team is very hardworking, and passionate about what they do. They are young, and that was the most impressive thing about his team, because we could easily gel with them. For the deal, he demanded 90% of the deal amount till the wedding. That's because of the same day edit he was showcasing on our last day evening (reception). And touchwood, he didn't let us down one bit. The teaser got most of the family members into tears, some were happy crying, some got emotional and I was just so proud of my decisions! Lakshay, Rahul, Sahil, and all others, thankkkkkyou so much for putting this all together in one good shape. Hope you guys achieve bigger heights! ***Less>>>

Being camera shy, my husband and I were unsure if cinematic video was something we wanted in the first place because the few samples we had seen online of various cinematographers included dance videos, which were well choreographed and this was the only deterrent for us until I spoke to nikhil and together, we figured out what it was that my husband and I wanted from the video.
