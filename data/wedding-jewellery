A few emails back and forth ensued (selecting a design, payment etc) On Friday, the 17th bright and early in the morning they emailed that my order had been shipped. By 7pm the same day, my earrings were in my hand !!! The quality and workmanship were faultless. ***

As soon as I entered the store it was totally spectacular I just loved the way they had displayed there collection plus the designs were totally enticing. Not only the designs but even there cost was totally in my budget.I would say the designs had a contemporary edge mixed with elements of personal style and sensibilities. The pearls string collection would make anybody look like a royalty. ***

In the end would like to say there designs, collection is soo exquisite and dainty plus the quality of the pearls is magnificent and the colors has Still  not faded inspite it had been worn so many times the craftsman ship of the earings and the necklace gives a traditional yet classy look. Therefore, I will definitely go back to Mangatrai to buy not only pearls but also there other pieces of diamonds and gold. ***Less>>>

I really regret putting this order through. I asked to have the order done by end of August. Still they were late. I asked for pictures before they send it off, and they only managed to send pictures of the bangles. I had asked them more than 4 times for pictures of my bridal set but they never send them and just decided to send the order off. ***
Order came in very late. By then father had already left Dehli. And once I saw my set I almost wanted to cry. It was horrible. Nothing like the set I saw originally. And still they don't see any fault. I recommend you not to order with them. I will now order a set from somewhere else. ***Less>>>
